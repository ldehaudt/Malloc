# Malloc

This recreation of the malloc, free, and realloc functions furthers my collection of homemade functions to replace basic function from the C library. This malloc includes defragmenting to minimize wasted space. Comes with a visualizer to see allocated blocks and how much memory is used in each.

Feel free to mess around with it, you can even replace the regular malloc with mine if you want.

Remember to enjoy ^-^

## Comiling and Running

Run `make` to compile. An executable will be created.

Run with:
```
./malloc_test
```
